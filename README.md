#  Introduction
This project explores a sales dataset and demonstrates how to conduct economic data analysis using Python. Below, you will find information about the data, how to set up and run the project, and a brief overview of the analysis results.

#  Data Overview
The dataset represents a series of sales transactions recorded by date, including fields for customer demographics, product details, and financial metrics 1
. Each row in the dataset contains:
-   Date, Year, and Month: The time of the transaction.
-   Customer Age and Customer Gender: Demographic information.
-   Country and State: Geographic location of the sale.
-   Product Category and Sub Category: Type of product sold (e.g., Accessories, Clothing, etc.).
-   Quantity: Number of items purchased in the transaction.
-   Unit Cost and Unit Price: Cost to the business and retail price per item.
-   Cost and Revenue: Total cost and revenue for each transaction, allowing for analysis of profit margins.

This structure makes it possible to explore sales patterns over time, compare customer segments, evaluate product performance, and assess profitability
